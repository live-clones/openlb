The gausspulse3d example initializes pressure with a gaussian distribution and velocity at (Ma, 0, 0). It is used to compare different boundary conditions with regards to their reflecting the pressure wave into the fluid domain.

To get the results, run

```
make
for boundaryCondition in 0 1 2 3
do
./gausspulse3d --boundaryCondition $boundaryCondition
done
for boundaryDepthLU in 5 10 30 50
do
./gausspulse3d --boundaryCondition 3 --boundaryDepthLU $boundaryDepthLU
done
python ./l2plot.py
```

NOTE: You need matplotlib for the python plots.

The gausspulse3d example initializes pressure with a gaussian distribution and velocity at (Ma, 0, 0). It is used to compare different boundary conditions with regards to their reflecting the pressure wave into the fluid domain.

To get the results, run

```
make
for boundaryCondition in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
do
./gausspulse3d ----FAR_FIELD_TYPE $boundaryCondition
done
cd ../refinedGausspulse3d
make
./refinedGausspulse3d
cd ../gausspulse3d
python ./l2plot.py
```

NOTE: You need matplotlib and numpy for the python plots.

To compare boundary-specific parameters, do something like
```
for sig in 0.1 0.03 0.01 0.003 0.001
do
mpirun ./gausspulse3d ----FAR_FIELD_TYPE 6 --CBC_SIGMA $sig
done
python ./l2plotCbcSigma.py
```

To get VTK and image output, add `--DO_GRAPHICAL_OUTPUT 1`

/* poiseuille3d.cpp:
 * This example examines a 3D Poseuille flow
 * It illustrates the usage of different flow setups, boundary conditions
 * and computation of error norms.
 * The following simulation options can be combined freely:
 * - if the compiler flag ENABLE_MRT is set, mrt collision operators are used
 * - forced/ nonForced flow
 * - different boundary conditions
 * - simulation only or eoc convergence analysis
 *
 * The main code of the simulation is in case.h as it is also used by the
 * example ../../pdeSolverEoc/poiseuille3dEoc
 *
 * Set flag in order to use mrt collision operators instead of bgk
 * #define ENABLE_MRT
